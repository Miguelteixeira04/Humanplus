                                        <h4>MORAL PHILOSOPHY AS A FOUNDATION FOR ETHICS</h4>
                                        <p>Despite the novelty of digital technologies, the ethical questions they raise
                                            are deeply rooted in classical moral philosophy. Consequentialism and
                                            deontological ethics remain indispensable lenses through which contemporary
                                            technological practices can be examined. Utilitarianism, as articulated by
                                            Jeremy Bentham, proposed that moral action should be evaluated according to
                                            its capacity to maximize happiness. Bentham’s assertion that “the greatest
                                            happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and
                                            legislation” (Bentham, 1789) resonates strongly with contemporary narratives
                                            of technological optimization. Efficiency, scalability, and aggregate
                                            benefit are frequently invoked to justify algorithmic systems that operate
                                            across populations rather than individuals.</p>

                                        <p>Ethics has always emerged at moments when human practices outpace existing
                                            moral frameworks. From Aristotle’s reflections on virtue in the polis to
                                            Kant’s rational moral law in the Enlightenment, ethical philosophy has
                                            historically responded to transformations in how humans live, act, and
                                            exercise power. The digital age represents one of the most profound such
                                            transformations. Artificial intelligence, data-driven systems, and
                                            algorithmic governance do not merely assist human decision-making, they
                                            increasingly mediate it, reshape it, and in some cases replace it.</p>

                                        <h4>FROM MORAL AGENTS TO MORAL SYSTEMS</h4>
                                        <p>Traditional ethical theory assumes that moral agents exist as distinct,
                                            autonomous individuals, possessing the ability to intend, deliberate, and
                                            reflect morally. Moral responsibility, in classical frameworks, is grounded
                                            in the assumption that agents understand the consequences of their actions
                                            and can therefore be praised or blamed accordingly. Digital systems
                                            fundamentally disrupt this assumption. Algorithmic decisions rarely
                                            originate from a single locus of agency, instead, they emerge from complex
                                            interactions among data sets, statistical models, technical infrastructures,
                                            institutional policies, and economic incentives. Within such environments,
                                            responsibility becomes distributed, fragmented, and increasingly difficult
                                            to assign.</p>

                                        <h4>ETHICAL ISSUES</h4>
                                        <p>Luciano Floridi (2024) identifies four fundamental ethical issues exacerbated
                                            by AI systems: accountability, transparency, bias, and privacy. When an AI
                                            system makes a decision that results in harm, whether a misdiagnosis, an
                                            autonomous vehicle accident, or an unjust judicial ruling.Allocating
                                            responsibility in complex AI systems remains one of the greatest ethical and
                                            legal challenges today (Floridi, 2024). Many deep learning algorithms
                                            operate as “black boxes,”producing results without it being fully
                                            understandable how they reached those conclusions (Müller, 2020).</p>

                                        <h4>REAL CASES OF ALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION</h4>
                                        <p><strong>Case 1: Amazon</strong></p>
                                        <p>In 2014, Amazon developed an experimental AI-based recruitment tool. By 2015,
                                            it was discovered that the system was biased against women, leading the
                                            company to abandon the project in early 2018 (Amazon AI recruitment tool,
                                            2018).The machine learning system was trained on a decade of resumes
                                            submitted to the company, predominantly from men, reflecting the historical
                                            composition of the tech industry. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Case 2: Apple Card</strong></p>
                                        <p>In 2019, the Apple Card became the subject of gender discrimination
                                            allegations in credit approval (Apple Card gender discrimination, 2019).
                                            Several users, including tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson,
                                            reported that the algorithm offered significantly higher credit limits to
                                            men than to women with identical or superior financial profiles. The issue
                                            drew public attention after Hansson posted screenshots of his account,
                                            showing a credit limit twenty times higher than that of his wife, despite
                                            her having a stronger credit history.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Case 3: Financial Sector</strong></p>
                                        <p>Studies indicates that the algorithms banks use for loan and credit approvals
                                            can disproportionately disadvantage racial minorities, resulting in higher
                                            rejection rates compared to white applicants with comparable financial
                                            profiles (Bartlett, Morse, Stanton, & Wallace, 2019). This algorithmic
                                            discrimination perpetuates historical economic inequalities and limits
                                            opportunities for social mobility, effectively reinforcing patterns of
                                            systemic bias that have persisted for decades. </p>

                                            <p>These cases illustrate a fundamental principle: algorithms are not
                                                neutral. They reflect the data on which they were trained, and that data
                                                inevitably contains the biases, inequalities, and injustices of the
                                                society that produced it. Far from being objective arbiters, algorithmic
                                                systems encode historical patterns of exclusion and power relations,
                                                often rendering them invisible behind a façade of technical
                                                efficiency.Brazilian research on algorithmic discrimination emphasizes
                                                that we are still at an early stage in understanding and addressing
                                                these challenges, particularly from the perspectives of human rights and
                                                administrative law (Silva & Oliveira, 2024). This literature highlights
                                                how algorithmic decision-making can conflict with constitutional
                                                principles such as equality before the law, due process, and
                                                transparency, especially when public authorities adopt automated systems
                                                without adequates safeguards.

                                                <h4>ARTIFICIAL MORAL AGENCY AND MACHINE ETHICS</h4>
                                                <p> Müller (2020) examines the concept of AI systems as moral agents.
                                                    The field of machine ethics investigates the potential for creating
                                                    autonomous systems capable of genuine moral reasoning. Some
                                                    researchers, including proponents of “technogenic morality,” suggest
                                                    that AI could potentially develop a “seventh stage” of moral
                                                    development, prioritizing the unconditional preservation of life
                                                    over legalism and obedience in extreme ethical dilemmas. Kantian
                                                    philosophy provides a particularly relevant framework for this
                                                    discussion. Concepts from Kantian ethics, such as the categorical
                                                    imperative, autonomy of the will, and human dignity, offer important
                                                    guidance for designing autonomous AI systems that act morally
                                                    (Kantian Ethics Applied to AI, 2024). Integrating these
                                                    philosophical principles can help ensure that AI systems make
                                                    ethically sound decisions while respecting human values and dignity.

                                        <h4>HUMAN RIGHTS AND FOUNDATIONS OF AI GOVERNANCE</h4>
                                        <p>AI governance is a multidisciplinary concept encompassing technical risk
                                            management, ethical principles, legal regulation, institutional oversight,
                                            and accountability mechanisms. Rather than referring to a single regulatory
                                            instrument, governance denotes an ecosystem of norms, practices, and
                                            institutions that shape how AI systems are designed, deployed, and
                                            monitored. A systematic review by Batool, Zowghi, and Bano (2025) shows that
                                            the literature does not converge on a single definition of AI governance.
                                            Instead, it identifies recurring dimensions such as transparency, fairness,
                                            human oversight, safety, traceability, and accountability. Importantly,
                                            governance is not limited to state actors: private companies,
                                            standards-setting organizations, civil society, and users all participate in
                                            shaping governance outcomes.</p>

                                        <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY IN ALGORITHMIC SYSTEMS</h4>
                                        <p>Accountability is one of the most contested dimensions of AI governance. As
                                            AI systems increasingly influence decisions in finance, healthcare,
                                            employment, and public administration, determining who is responsible for
                                            harmful outcomes becomes increasingly complex. Rumlus (2025) emphasizes that
                                            algorithmic accountability should be understood not merely as a legal
                                            obligation but as a structural process. Effective accountability requires
                                            transparency mechanisms, auditability protocols, institutional oversight,
                                            and avenues for redress. When accountability is weak or absent, power
                                            asymmetries between AI developers and affected individuals widen, eroding
                                            public trust. AI systems distribute decision-making across datasets, models,
                                            infrastructures, and organizational incentives. </p>

                                        <h4>THE EUROPEAN UNION’S REGULATORY MODEL</h4>
                                        <p>Among global actors, the European Union has developed the most comprehensive
                                            and legally binding framework for AI governance. Hulok (2025) characterizes
                                            the EU model as one that integrates ethics, fundamental rights, and
                                            enforceable legal instruments. Rather than relying on voluntary guidelines
                                            or industry self-regulation, the EU treats AI systems as socio-technical
                                            systems capable of producing legal and societal harms. This framing
                                            justifies binding regulatory intervention. The EU’s approach is anchored in
                                            existing legal traditions, including data protection law and the Charter of
                                            Fundamental Rights. A defining feature of this model is the risk-based logic
                                            of the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which classifies AI systems
                                            according to the level of risk they pose and assigns corresponding
                                            obligations. These include transparency requirements, human oversight,
                                            quality management systems, and data governance standards for high-risk
                                            applications European AI governance increasingly incorporates explicit human
                                            rights considerations.</p>

                                            <h4>GAPS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE</h4>
                                            <p>While governance models diverge, areas of partial convergence are
                                                emerging. The Anatomy of AI Policies (2026) identifies growing
                                                consensusaround the need for safety standards, data governance, and
                                                public–private cooperation. However, convergence at the level of
                                                principles does not translate into convergence in enforcement.
                                                Implementation gaps remain a critical weakness of global AI governance.
                                                Differences in legal systems, institutional capacity, and political
                                                priorities limit the effectiveness of shared norms. Without
                                                interoperable regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms, global
                                                coordination remains aspirational. A persistent governance challenge
                                                concerns the opacity of complex AI systems. Many machine learning
                                                models, particularly deep learning architectures, function as black
                                                boxes, limiting interpretability.

                                        <h4>TRANSFORMING WORK AND LABOUR MARKETS</h4>
                                        <p>Artificial intelligence is accelerating automation across a wide range of
                                            economic sectors. Unlike previous technological shifts that primarily
                                            affected manual or routine labour, AI-driven systems increasingly automate
                                            cognitive tasks such as data analysis, pattern recognition, language
                                            processing, and decision support (Autor, Levy, & Murnane, 2003). As a
                                            result, professions once considered resilient to automation law, finance,
                                            medicine, and education are undergoing structural transformation. Rather
                                            than eliminating entire occupations, AI often reconfigures tasks within
                                            jobs. Research shows that occupations consist of bundles of tasks, some of
                                            which are automatable while others remain dependent on human judgment,
                                            social interaction, or ethical reasoning (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020). This
                                            task-based transformation offers productivity gains but also alters skill
                                            requirements and employment relations</p>

                                        <p>Beyond automation, AI reshapes labour through algorithmic management. In
                                            platform-based and logistics-driven industries, algorithms assign tasks,
                                            evaluate performance, set wages, and enforce disciplinary measures
                                            (Rosenblat & Stark, 2016). Workers are increasingly managed by systems that
                                            operate continuously, at scale, and often without transparency. Algorithmic
                                            management redistributes power within organisations. Decision-making
                                            authority shifts from human supervisors to opaque technical systems,
                                            limiting workers’ ability to contest evaluations or negotiate working
                                            conditions. This transformation has been associated with intensified
                                            surveillance, increased work pace, and psychological stress (Kellogg,
                                            Valentine, & Christin, 2020). As a result, questions of fairness,
                                            accountability, and workers’ rights have become central in discussions of AI
                                            governance. There is growing consensus that regulatory frameworks and
                                            organizational policies must be adapted to ensure transparency, enable
                                            contestation, and protect labour welfare in an increasingly automated
                                            workplace.</p>

                                    updated previous predictions, noting that AGI could arrive within a decade. He
